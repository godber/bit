# TRON Bit

Interactive Three.js visualization of the TRON Bit, now rendered through React Three Fiber. The experience is powered by React 19, Vite, and Bun, showcasing smooth wireframe transitions, press-and-hold interactions, and responsive layout.

## Prerequisites
- [Bun](https://bun.sh/) ≥ 1.1 (project declares `bun@1.1.10` in `package.json`)

## Install
```sh
bun install
```

## Development
Start Vite’s dev server with hot reloading:
```sh
bun run dev
```

The app defaults to http://localhost:5173. The Vite config (`vite.config.js`) opens the browser automatically.

## Build & Preview
Create a production bundle in `dist/`:
```sh
bun run build
```

Serve the built assets locally:
```sh
bun run preview
```

Deploy by serving the static files emitted into `dist/`. Ensure the hosting environment supports module scripts generated by Vite.

## Project Structure
- `index.html` bootstraps the React app.
- `src/main.jsx` hydrates the React tree.
- `src/App.jsx` renders layout, wires press-and-hold interactions, and hosts the Canvas.
- `src/BitScene.jsx` contains the React Three Fiber scene graph and animation logic.
- `public/` (optional) can host static assets that Vite copies through untouched.
- `vite.config.mjs` holds Vite settings (currently just `root`, `server.open`, and the React plugin).

## Manual Testing
No automated tests exist yet. After `bun run dev`, validate manually on desktop and mobile browsers:
- Confirm the idle state renders the blue nested icosahedra.
- Press and hold the YES button; yellow cube should cross-fade in, and releasing returns to idle.
- Press and hold the NO button; orange spiky geometry should cross-fade in, and releasing returns to idle.
- Lose window focus during a press (e.g., Alt+Tab) to ensure the scene reverts to idle.
- Observe that press-and-hold buttons update their `aria-pressed` state appropriately.
